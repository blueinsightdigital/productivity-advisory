a list of productivity advisories and time hacks for developers

## Problem Management
- **Scope Reduction** - When faced with an issue, reduce the problem definition to the narrowest scope
- **Shift Left** - when faced with a downstream problem, replicate the narrowest definition of the same upstream. For example, in your dev environment, based on a wider production environment concern.
- **Share Your Problem Story** - Problems are good. Problems should be rare. For both of them to be true, your problem stories should be well documented and transparent to your team through your workflow process. For example, an evidence-based approach over the full lifecycle of the problem on GitHub might include comprehensive issue documentation both before, and post-facto, including clear and well documented explanations of each developer story in their mitigation efforts - along with remedial actions surfaced through the postmortem process.
